## Project Outline

The Gentle Path is a sanctuary for individuals living with chronic pain, offering beginner friendly information to support mental health, wellness, and emotional resilience. The site is designed to foster hope and healing through tranquil visuals, empowering quotes, and practical wellness strategies. The Gentle Path helps users feel seen, soothed, and supported through engaging in online group sessions for community-driven inspiration and personal one-on-one support from trained therapists —encouraging small, sustainable steps toward greater peace, strength, and self-care.

## Features

### Navigation

- The navbar is a Bootstrap component that allows for easy navigation and responsive design. It is used across all pages with a simple, neutral coloured design with links to the Logo, Home, Learn and Contact. Links to Practise and Resources are not yet available.

- The navbar will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. Active links become bold when navigating through pages so the user know which area they are currently using.

### Hero section

- **Visual Theme:** The AI generated hero image evokes serenity and resilience through soft, natural tones and symbolic elements like a winding path, gentle light, and tranquil landscapes—reflecting the emotional journey of chronic pain and healing.

- **Purpose and Impact:** Designed to immediately convey comfort and hope, the image sets the emotional tone for the site, inviting users into a safe, supportive space where wellness and mental health are prioritized.

- **Brand Alignment:** The composition aligns with The Gentle Path’s core values—empathy, empowerment, and transformation—serving as a visual anchor for the site's identity and reinforcing its mission to uplift and connect.

- **Text:** The text welcomes users to the site and has a brief sentence to explain the sites purpose.

- **Buttons:** Two button are placed in the lower righthand corner. The "Need Help?" button allows a user to be directed straight to the Help and Support section. The "Start Guided Meditation" button gives the user the opportunity to try a meditation session through a link to a YouTube video by 'Lavendaire'.

### Bootstrap carousel

- **Dynamic Affirmation Display:** The Bootstrap carousel cycles through uplifting affirmations, creating a gentle rhythm of encouragement that reinforces the site's themes of resilience, hope, and emotional support.

- **Responsive and Accessible:** Optimized for all screen sizes, the carousel ensures affirmations remain visually engaging and easy to read, offering users a calming, interactive experience across devices.

### About section

- **Responsive Design for Accessibility:** The use of Bootstrap card layout adapts across all devices, ensuring that our message remains clear, comforting, and easy to navigate whether viewed on mobile, tablet, or desktop.

### Where To Start

- **User-Centered Clarity:** Dealing with chronic pain can be a difficult and confusing time with many people not knowing where to begin to get thier life back on track. Each card in this section highlights a specific stage in order for users to begin understand and cope with their mental health issues and struggles through chronic pain. It helps users quickly understand how The Gentle Path can assist them on their healing journey.

### Help and Support

- **Access to Support:** The section provides clear, actionable options “Helpline” and “Book Online Session”, allowing users to quickly connect with emotional and wellness support tailored to chronic pain and mental health needs.

- **Intuitive Circular Design:** Circular containers draw visual attention and convey peace and approachability, reinforcing the site's gentle aesthetic while making key support features easy to identify and engage with.

- **Fully Responsive Layout:** This section ensures seamless access to help resources whether users are browsing on mobile, tablet, or desktop—support is always within reach.

### Footer

- **Visual Consistency:** Matching the footer color to the navbar creates a cohesive, polished look across the site, reinforcing brand identity and promoting a calm, unified aesthetic.

- **Accessible Connectivity:** Evenly spaced social media icons offer users clear, balanced access to external platforms, encouraging community engagement while maintaining visual harmony and ease of navigation.

### Learn Page

- **Supportive Mental Health Education:** The Learn page gently guides users living with chronic pain, toward understanding the connection between physical and emotional wellbeing. It offers clear, compassionate information on mental health, therapy options, and coping strategies to help users take the first step in managing their inner world.

- **Consistent, Calming Design:** Styled in harmony with the site’s tranquil aesthetic, the Learn page maintains the same soft colour palette, typography, and layout as other sections—creating a peaceful, cohesive experience that encourages exploration without overwhelm.

### Features Left to Implement

- **Practise Page** The Practice page would offer users a calming, supportive space to explore holistic techniques—like meditation, breathwork, yoga, gentle movement, and nutrition advice—alongside practical coping strategies and tools that nurture both body and mind on the journey through chronic pain and emotional healing.

- **Resources Page** The Resources page would serve as a curated hub for deeper exploration, offering trusted links, insightful articles, and expert-backed content to empower users with knowledge and practical guidance.

## Wireframe

- The project's wireframes serve as the skeletal blueprint, illustrating the foundational structure, layout, and functionality of the application before visual design elements were applied. They were developed to map out the user flow and hierarchy of information, ensuring a logical and intuitive user experience.

- There were minor alterations during the building process to improve the flow of the document and user experience.

#### HTML

**Landing Page**
No errors found on second validation.
The first check of my HTML raised a few errors regarding header semantics which I quickly corrected.

**Learn Page**
No errors found on second validation.
On my first attempt there were 62 errors. These were all linked to duplicate ID's on the card accordions which is why they weren't working as expected. ID's were changed and everything works correctly.

### Lighthouse

A Lighthouse audit was conducted using the tool on Chrome Devtools of each web page.

**Home Page**
I initially had a performance score of 77 due to the size of the images. I scaled down the size on all .jpg images and improved my score to 79. It was my hero image that was causing the poor performance so I used [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com) to change my AI generated .png image into .webp and ran the lighthouse again and its increased to 98.
