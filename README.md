## Project Outline

The Gentle Path is a sanctuary for individuals living with chronic pain, offering beginner friendly information to support mental health, wellness, and emotional resilience. The site is designed to foster hope and healing through tranquil visuals, empowering quotes, and practical wellness strategies. The Gentle Path helps users feel seen, soothed, and supported through engaging in online group sessions for community-driven inspiration and personal one-on-one support from trained therapists â€”encouraging small, sustainable steps toward greater peace, strength, and self-care.
