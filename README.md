# The Gentle Path

## Introduction 

The Gentle Path is my first assessed portfolio project developed as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp, consisting of learning outcomes to utilise HTML5, CSS3 & Bootstrap in order to fulfil the necessary requirements for the brief provided about Mental Health.

## Project Outline

The Gentle Path is a sanctuary for individuals living with chronic pain, offering beginner friendly information to support mental health, wellness, and emotional resilience. The site is designed to foster hope and healing through tranquil visuals, empowering quotes, and practical wellness strategies. The Gentle Path helps users feel seen, soothed, and supported through engaging in online group sessions for community-driven inspiration and personal one-on-one support from trained therapists —encouraging small, sustainable steps toward greater peace, strength, and self-care.

## Features

### Navigation

- The navbar is a Bootstrap component that allows for easy navigation and responsive design. It is used across all pages with a simple, neutral coloured design with links to the Logo, Home, Learn and Contact. Links to Practise and Resources are not yet available.

- The navbar will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. Active links become bold when navigating through pages so the user know which area they are currently using.

### Hero section

- **Visual Theme:** The AI generated hero image evokes serenity and resilience through soft, natural tones and symbolic elements like a winding path, gentle light, and tranquil landscapes—reflecting the emotional journey of chronic pain and healing.

- **Purpose and Impact:** Designed to immediately convey comfort and hope, the image sets the emotional tone for the site, inviting users into a safe, supportive space where wellness and mental health are prioritized.

- **Brand Alignment:** The composition aligns with The Gentle Path’s core values—empathy, empowerment, and transformation—serving as a visual anchor for the site's identity and reinforcing its mission to uplift and connect.

- **Text:** The text welcomes users to the site and has a brief sentence to explain the sites purpose.

- **Buttons:** Two button are placed in the lower righthand corner. The "Need Help?" button allows a user to be directed straight to the Help and Support section. The "Start Guided Meditation" button gives the user the opportunity to try a meditation session through a link to a YouTube video by 'Lavendaire'.

### Where To Start section

- **User-Centered Clarity:** Dealing with chronic pain can be a difficult and confusing time with many people not knowing where to begin to get thier life back on track. Each card in this section highlights a specific stage in order for users to begin understand and cope with their mental health issues and struggles through chronic pain. It helps users quickly understand how The Gentle Path can assist them on their healing journey.

## Features Left to Implement

- **Resources Page** The Resources page would serve as a curated hub for deeper exploration, offering trusted links, insightful articles, and expert-backed content to empower users with knowledge and practical guidance.
