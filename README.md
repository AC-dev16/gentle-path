# The Gentle Path

## Introduction 

The Gentle Path is my first assessed portfolio project developed as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp, consisting of learning outcomes to utilise HTML5, CSS3 & Bootstrap in order to fulfil the necessary requirements for the brief provided about Mental Health.

## Project Outline

The Gentle Path is a sanctuary for individuals living with chronic pain, offering beginner friendly information to support mental health, wellness, and emotional resilience. The site is designed to foster hope and healing through tranquil visuals, empowering quotes, and practical wellness strategies. The Gentle Path helps users feel seen, soothed, and supported through engaging in online group sessions for community-driven inspiration and personal one-on-one support from trained therapists —encouraging small, sustainable steps toward greater peace, strength, and self-care.

## Features

- This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
